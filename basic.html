    <pre>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[pron 1] (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) 
    was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist
    who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's
    independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom
    across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'),
     first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.</pre>
